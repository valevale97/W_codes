LAST UPDATE: 06/12/2022

The repository contains 3 separate folders:
-   tomoanalyticV contains Mirko's MATLAB script on analytical tomography, where the weight function is built from the projected velocities only, assuming a set of 
    (FIDA?) sightlines. The signal is added some noise and then inverted using a (modulable) combination of 0th and 1st order Tikhonov regularization.
-   AnalyticalTomo contains instead the python counterpart of "tomoanalyticV", where the essential features of the code are translated into the new language.
-   wcodes contains new Mirko's code on weight functions, from neutron to 1-step gamma ray to FIDA.
